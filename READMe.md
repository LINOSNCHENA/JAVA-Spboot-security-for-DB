##  Different access layers per security classification

1. Register Users/Administrators
2. Login for Administrators
3. Login for users
4. Login for public

Two tables were created to implement the security systemâ€™s feature; Table #1 is used to save the list of authorised users, and Table #2 is used for the classification of types of  authorised users. Password is automatically masked by the spring boot security API. A hashing algorithm encrypts the password before storage in database. Remember to fill database with at least one Admin user before using the systems, for activation purposes
